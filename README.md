# React Dev Assignment -

1. You have to develop a demo react app (for mobile and web). Set up a React project using CRA and if you know TypeScript and SASS, use them - youâ€™ll earn bonus points
2. The app is a simplified search app with following requirements:
   - Click on the search tab latest trend suggestion box open
   - Implement faker api for showing data.
   - According to the filter data should update.
   - Click on the Wishlist colour should change to red
   - On hovering to the product view product button should be visible.
   - The look & feel should match the design specs mentioned in this [link](https://www.figma.com/proto/uImaHzeMhKCO8pvpC6f76U/Search-and-Search-results?node-id=2-5&scaling=scale-down) here.
   - Use atomic commits; so commit as much as you can!!
   - You have to use functional react components with hooks (No class components at all!!!)
